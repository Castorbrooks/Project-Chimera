# Project Chimera

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

This is not a project. This is a collection of tools and thought experiments I've developed over the years to understand, break, and rebuild autonomous systems.

## 🧠 The Core Philosophy

Most developers build. I deconstruct. I believe that true mastery of a system comes not from its creation, but from understanding its every failure point, its every hidden variable, and its every potential for exploitation.

This repository contains modules for:
- **Protocol Dissection:** Reverse-engineering smart contracts and bot logic.
- **Signal Analysis:** Finding patterns in market noise and bot behavior.
- **System Resurrection:** Bringing dead or failing systems back to life.

## 🗿 The Artifacts

The real work is not in the code, but in the mind. The scripts here are merely echoes of the thought process.

- `modules/analysis/`: Tools for breaking down complex systems.
- `modules/resurrection/`: Protocols for reviving dead projects.
- `labs/`: Experimental concepts and unfinished thoughts.

## 🤝 The Covenant

I do not provide support. I do not accept pull requests. This is a record of my work, a personal grimoire.

If you have a system that is beyond repair, a problem that no one can solve, you can reach me.
